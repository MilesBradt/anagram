## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone GitHub URL in terminal_
* _In terminal, cd into lib folder_
* _type 'irb' in terminal_
* _type 'load "anagram.rb"'_
* _type 'new_test = String.new()''
* _type 'new_test.anagram_check?(**the first set of words you want to put go here**, **the second set of words you want to put go here**)'_

## Known Bugs

  * _Both sentences have to have the same amount of words, otherwise will break_

  *  _Extra chracters besides letters will need to be included in the word or else it wont check for them_

  * _Even if they aren't technically words in the english dictionary, they'll still count as an anagram_
